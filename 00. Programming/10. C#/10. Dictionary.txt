What is Dictionary ? 

Dictionary is just like array or List BUT every element is represented like Key-Value Pair ! 

Why Dictionary ? 

Let say we have 100 students and EACH student has : (Name and Age)
We can easily create array/List for all the student names 
and 
create second array/List for all the student ages

BUT 

with dictionaries we can create 1 Dictionary<TKey,TValue> students;

Dictionary<string, int> students = new Dictionary<string, int>();

for the Keys we will put their Names 
and for Values -> their Ages

students.Add("Emo",20);



okey so now our students have ClassNumber ! and we must save their ClassNumber, Name, Age

with Dictionaries we can create Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, int>> students;
